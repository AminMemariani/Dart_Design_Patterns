# Dart Design Patterns

A collection of classic design patterns implemented in Dart, with a focus on clarity and educational value. Suitable for Flutter and backend Dart developers.

## Included Patterns

- [Singleton](https://github.com/AminMemariani/Dart_Design_Patterns/blob/master/Singleton/singleton.dart)  
  Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- [Factory](https://github.com/AminMemariani/Dart_Design_Patterns/blob/master/Factory/factory.dart)  
  Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

- [Builder](https://github.com/AminMemariani/Dart_Design_Patterns/blob/master/Builder/builder.dart)  
  Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

- [Strategy](https://github.com/AminMemariani/Dart_Design_Patterns/blob/master/Strategy/strategy.dart)  
  Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.

- [Observer](https://github.com/AminMemariani/Dart_Design_Patterns/blob/master/Observer/observer.dart)  
  Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

- [Adapter](https://github.com/AminMemariani/Dart_Design_Patterns/blob/master/Adapter/adapter.dart)  
  Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

- [Decorator](https://github.com/AminMemariani/Dart_Design_Patterns/blob/master/Decorator/decorator.dart)  
  Adds behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
